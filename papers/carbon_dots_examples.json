In a typical one-step synthesizing procedure, 2.0 g of O. basilicum L. seed was added to 100 mL of distilled water and stirred at 50 °C for 2 h. Then, the obtained extract was filtered and transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave to be heated at 180 °C for 4 h. Once the autoclave was cooled naturally at room temperature and the solution was centrifuged (12,000 rpm) for 15 min, the prepared brown solution was filtered through a fine-grained 0.45 μm membrane to remove larger particles. Finally, the solution was freeze-dried to attain the dark brown powder of CQDs.",

Prior to the irradiation, the target was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath made of acetone for 15 min. The target was then placed inside a 50 mL single-neck glass flask and covered by 5 mL of acetone (@99.99% purity from Thermo Fisher Scientific). The laser beam was shined onto a flat mirror, inclined at 45° with respect to the laser rail, and then focused on the surface of the target by using a biconvex lens having a focal length of 167 mm. The lens was located between the mirror and the flask. The power of the laser was 13 W with an energy per pulse of 13 mJ at 1 kHz. The average spot size of the laser beam was measured to be around ∼96 ± 12 μm. Consequently, the fluence was calculated to be around ∼179 ± 31 J cm–2. Finally, the target was irradiated for 5 min. Immediately, after synthesis, the colloid was centrifuged for 60 s at 13,250 rcf (corresponding to 13,000 rpm) to remove possible chunk and debris from the bulk target. Finally, the colloid was stored in a 10 mL opaque microtube to protect the colloid from contamination and evaporation.",

Certain portions of the stock solutions were kept aside for experiments as reference compound and for comparison.

The resulting clear solutions showed different shades of yellow. The change of color acted as an indicator for the formation of the CDs. The color changed the least for the treatment at 180 °C. Each sample was passed through sterilized 0.2 μm chromatography filter to ensure the removal of all suspended large particles. The CD solutions showed blue to cyan characteristic fluorescence upon subjecting to UV light.",

A desired mass of AC was carefully weighed using an analytical electronic balance (Ohaus CV314C) and transferred to a beaker glass. Two hundred milliliters of ultrapure water was added, and the AC suspension was stirred at 1500 rpm for 30 min using a magnetic stirrer (JoanLab SH-2, China) and transferred to a conical flask. It was then irradiated under microwave power for 3–7 min. The resulting pale brown mixture was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 30 min to remove impurities; the supernatant was then filtered using filter paper (Whatman, No. 40) and further purified using a 0.22 μm nylon filter syringe. The pure CQDs were then dried using an oven until solid brownish CQDs were obtained.",

        "text": "Carbon dots were prepared by microwave assisted synthesis as per procedure provided by Milosavljevic et al. [24] with a little modification. In brief, 0.2 g of GG was dispersed in 20 mL of distilled water under normal stirring for 2 h to ensure its complete dissolution. Now, the solution was placed in the microwave oven (LG, model No. CE1041DFB, USA) and heated till the volume decreased to one fifth along with the color change from transparent to yellowish-red. The optimization of the reaction time in the microwave-assisted heating was also performed. The results indicated that it took almost 25–30 min to prepare carbon dots. It is worth mentioning here that the solution was exposed to microwaves only for 30 s and then allowed to stand for 5 min to avoid overheating. In all, five to six exposures were required for synthesis of CDs. Finally, the solution was cooled down to room temperature and then 30 mL of distilled water was added under moderate stirring. The brownish-yellow dark solution was centrifuged (Remi, India) for 15 min with revolution speed of 50,000 rpm. The pale yellow supernatant was collected in test tubes, covered with aluminum foils and kept in dark chamber for further use.",

        "text": "L-/D-Cys-derived CDots were synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method. Briefly, 0.1 g of L- or D-Cys was sufficiently dissolved in 10 ml of water. Then, this solution was transferred to a 50-ml Teflon-sealed autoclave and heated at (i) 100/150/200/250°C for 4 h and (ii) 150°C for 1–20 h. If needed, the pH of the resulting solutions was adjusted to 7 using 0.1 M NaOH. Then, solutions were purified by passing through a 0.22-μm filter membrane (see Figure S1) and dialysing against deionized water in a 1-kDa dialysis bag for 24 h. The pH of the NP dispersion after dialysis was found to be neutral, or the same pH as Millipore water, which means that unreacted cysteine and ultra-small molecular aggregates were removed. Also, all the samples were of 10 ml of volume, whereas the dialysis tank was 500 ml, which was also stirred to make the system homogenous. Thus, decreasing the concentration of solutes in about 50 times ensures better purification. As a result of hydrothermal synthesis and a further two-step purification procedure, ~10 mg of product was produced per 10 ml of purified solution.",

In this facility, DNA was extracted\nas described in ref. 2 and was treated with the enzyme uracil-DNA-glycosylase (UDG)3\n, which\nremoves uracil residues from DNA to leave abasic sites4\n3\n, as well as the enzyme endonuclease\nVIII (Endo VIII), which cuts the DNA at the 5´ and 3´ sides of abasic sites. Subsequent\nincubation with T4 polynucleotide kinase and T4 DNA polymerase was used to generate blunt\nand 5´-phosphorylated ends amenable to adaptor ligation. Since the great majority of uracil\nresidues occur close to the ends of ancient DNA molecules, this procedure leads only to a\nmoderate reduction in the average lengths of the molecules in the library but a several-fold\nreduction in nucleotide misincorporation due to the removal of uracil residues from the library .\nTwo independent libraries were created using this approach (SL3003 and SL3004) with a\nmodified Illumina multiplex protocol5\n. A 7nt-index (5'-GTCGACT-3') not available outside of\nthe clean room, as well as outer adapter sequences required for sequencing, were then added by a\nPCR reaction that was set up inside the clean room but performed outside the clean room.

        "text": "Methods\nAncient DNA studies are extremely susceptible to contamination with extraneous DNA,\nand must demonstrate adequate experimental and authentication procedures (S1).\nConsequently, all manipulation of ancient samples prior to PCR amplification were\nperformed in dedicated ancient DNA laboratories at the Zoological Institute of University\nof Copenhagen and the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, in areas free from\nother molecular research. Appropriate negative extraction and amplification controls were\nused throughout (at a ratio of 1:5 and 1:1 for the extraction and amplification steps\nrespectively), along with rigorous authentication procedures such as cloning to investigate\ncontamination, jumping PCR products, and other damage-related artifacts (S1-S6).\nIndependently replicated samples and sequences are given in Tables 1-3. Real-time PCR\nwas not possible due to varying levels of inhibition in the different samples.\nSample information\nThe permafrost samples (Table 1) were obtained from one pit-hole and six cores\ndrilled along approximately 1200 km of the Arctic coast, in a tundra zone with\ncontinuous permafrost and a ground temperature between –9 to –12ºC. The seasonal\nthawing zone was within the top 0.3-0.5m, and the thickness of the permafrost was\ncalculated to be 800-1000m (S7), with no water infiltration or water-bearing horizons\n(S8). The latter is important to rule out the possibility of sample migration. The\nsamples were fine dispersed sandy-loam and loamy lacustrine-alluvial sediments,\nrepresenting a slightly reducing (average pH 6-7) and anaerobic (Eh +40 to -250)\nenvironment. The hydrocarbon and fatty acid composition of the core samples\nindicates a primarily vegetative origin with a smaller portion of bacterial origin (S9).\nEpifluorescence microscopy revealed cells in the bacterial size range (about 107cells/\ngram wet weight, average cell volume 0.03-0.05 µm3/cell).\nThe NZ cave samples were collected from the Clutha Valley, Otago, and consisted of\ncolluvial/aeolian reworking of the weathered schist of the surrounding area, with a\nconsiderable organic macrofossil component. The coastal moa bone (MNZ S\nunregistered) was from an in situ late Holocene paleosol dune deposit, collected by T.\nWorthy in Jan, 2003.

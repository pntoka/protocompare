Briefly, Punica granatum juice was obtained by grinding 400 g of Punica granatum fruits, and 500 mL of the juice was transferred into a 750 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and then heated at 170 °C for 12 h. After heating, the product was left to cool down naturally, and a dark brown liquid was obtained, indicating the formation of C-dots. The effect of duration of heating (3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 h) on the yield of C-dots was investigated. Finally, the C-dots were collected by dialysis against deionized water though a dialysis membrane for 12 h and stored at 4 °C for further use.

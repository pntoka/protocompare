The C-dots were synthesized from the methionine and ethylenediamine co-precursors via a one-pot hydrothermal method. Scheme 1 illustrates the synthesis of as-prepared C-dots. Samples with various molar feed ratios of 1 : 0.5, 1 : 1, 1 : 2, 1 : 5 and 1 : 10 (methionine : EDA) were investigated. Briefly, a certain amount of methionine (5 mmol) and varying amount of ethylenediamine were dissolved in 10 mL deionized water. The reaction mixture was stirred rapidly to obtain a clear and homogeneous solution. Then the mixture solution was transferred into a 50 mL autoclave and placed in a hot air oven at 200 °C for 5 h. After 5 h reaction, a deep yellow solution was collected. The C-dots were collected through a dialysis membrane (MWCO = 3000 Da) for 24 h and finally dried under vacuum for 48 h.
